I'll simplify the structure to only show the carousel banner component, removing the extra examples and documentation.

I'll help you create 3 banner slides inspired by books, but I cannot scrape content from the specific website you mentioned as that would involve reproducing copyrighted material. Instead, I'll create book-themed banners with generic content that you can customize with your own materials.

Feat: Implement book slides with excerpts
Preview

I've created 3 book-themed banner slides with generic literary content. The slides use book-related imagery and messaging that you can customize with your own content. To add specific books and excerpts from the publisher you mentioned, you would need to manually replace the titles, subtitles, and background images with your own materials while respecting copyright restrictions.

Looking at your code, I can see the issue. The Banner component is expecting the backgroundImage prop to be an Unsplash photo ID (like "photo-1234567890"), but you're passing a local file path. Let me fix this by updating the Banner component to handle local images properly.

The issue was that the Banner component was hardcoded to use Unsplash URLs, but now it properly handles both local file paths and Unsplash photo IDs.
